## What is Positive Disruption?

Positive Disruption is a framework for exploring potential scenarios in which technologies and practices that impact GHG emissions, referred to as â€˜climate solution verticals', might be adopted between now and the end of the century, globally and by nation, and estimating their impact on GHG emissions.

The Positive Disruption model explores how the adoption of a set of climate solution verticals, when assumed to have optionality for nonlinear adoption curves, can impact GHG emissions. It provides timeseries estimates of global progress as a summation of national progress.

Suggested uses for the model include:

- To explore climate trajectories that are influenced by technology market disruption
- To understand options for applying additional market acceleration efforts
